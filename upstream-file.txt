This is a sample file in the upstream with several lines. 

This file is to be used for sync testing by:

1.) editting different lines in upstream and origin to confirm changes can be auto-merged
2.) editting the same line(s) in upstream and origin, thus creating a conflict to be manually resolved

Here's some very basic code snippet

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args){

    System.out.println("Hello World");
    foo();
  }
  
  private void foo(){
  
    System.out.println('Main.foo');
  }
}
